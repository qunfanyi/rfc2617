### 4.12 Spoofing by Counterfeit Servers  

~~[en]Basic Authentication is vulnerable to spoofing by counterfeit servers.~~  
基本认证容易受到伪造服务器的欺骗。  

~~[en]If a user can be led to believe that she is connecting to a host containing information protected by a password she knows, when in fact she is connecting to a hostile server, then the hostile server can request a password, store it away for later use, and feign an error.~~  
如果用户能够被引导相信她正在连接到包含由她知道的密码保护的信息的主机，那么当她实际上正在连接到恶意服务器时，恶意服务器可以请求密码，将其存储起来供以后使用，并假装错误。  

~~[en]This type of attack is more difficult with Digest Authentication -- but the client must know to demand that Digest authentication be used, perhaps using some of the techniques described above to counter "man-in-the-middle" attacks.~~  
使用摘要身份验证时，这种类型的攻击更加困难——但是客户机必须知道需要使用摘要身份验证，可能使用上面描述的一些技术来对付“中间人”攻击。  

~~[en]Again, the user can be helped in detecting this attack by a visual indication of the authentication mechanism in use with appropriate guidance in interpreting the implications of each scheme.~~  
同样，通过在解释每个方案的含义时使用适当的指导，对认证机制的视觉指示可以帮助用户检测这种攻击。
